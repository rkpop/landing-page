# landing-page

Landing page for [/r/kpop Homepage](https://redditkpop.com).

## Develop

* Install Sass CLI
* Watch the build

```bash
sass --watch --sourcemap=none sass/styling.scss:css/styling.css
```

* Make the changes
* Push to repo

## Reason to commit Bulma

I don't want to initiate a package manager just for one page, and one Sass file. It's unnecessary.
